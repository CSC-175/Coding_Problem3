# Interleave Arrays

## Directions
Write a program that uses a function named <b>interleave</b> that will accept four arrays and their lengths as input. The function will interleave the elements of the first three arrays passed into the fourth array (named <b>interleaved</b>). <b>Note: The program must work with arrays of any lengths. You cannot assume that arrayA (as seen in example) is always the longest.</b>
The elements are interleaved as follows: arrayA[0], arrayB[0], arrayC[0], arrayA[1], arrayB[1], arrayC[1], etc... 
The source code for the interleave function must be placed inside the <b>P3.cpp</b> file.

The animation below shows the interleaving of three arrays into the array named interleaved.
