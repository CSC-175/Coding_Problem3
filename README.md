# Interleave Arrays

## Directions
Write a program that uses a function named <b>interleave</b> that will accept four arrays and their lengths as input,  
interleave the elements of the first three arrays of different sizes into a fourth array named <b>interleaved</b>. 
The elements are interleaved as follows: arrayA[0], arrayB[0], arrayC[0], arrayA[1], arrayB[1], arrayC[1], etc... 
The source code for interleave must be placed inside the <b>P4.cpp</b> file.

The animation below shows the interleaving of three arrays into the array named interleaved.
